## Guide to running Ubuntu 20.04 on different operating systems
<p> Windows You have three options for running Ubuntu on Windows:</p>

- WSL: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a feature that allows you to run Linux distributions natively on Windows.
WSL is the easiest option to set up and use, and it provides a good introduction to Ubuntu.
Vagrant: Vagrant is a tool for creating and managing virtual machines. It is a good option if you need to run Ubuntu
for development or testing purposes, as it allows you to create isolated environments that are easy to replicate and share.
Docker: Docker is a tool for containerizing applications. It is a good option if you need to run Ubuntu for specific tasks,
such as running a web server or database. But also remember using docker will need an installation of WSL.
macOS If you have:

a Mac with an Apple Silicon chip, you can only use Docker to run Ubuntu.
a Mac with an Intel chip, you can use Vagrant or Docker.
This project introduces you to all the available options. Go through them and choose the one that works for you.
